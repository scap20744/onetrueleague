1. Divisions
   1. The Teams are organized into three Divisions of four Teams each.
   1. Assignments of Team to Division remain the same from season to season.

## 2. Officers

## 3. Finances

1. The Entry Fee for the League is $75 per team per season.
   1. Each Team's Owner is expected to pay the Entry Fee to the Bursar prior to the start of each season's Draft.  A grace period is offered when reasonable circumstances prevent the Entry Fee from being paid on time.
1. The Entry Fees collected for all Teams each season form the season's Purse.
   1. League operational expenses are deducted from the Purse.
1. At the conclusion of each season, the Purse is paid without undue delay by the Bursar to the Owners by dividing it according to the following formula: 70% to the Champion; 15% to the Runner-Up; 7.5% to each of the remaining two playoff teams.
   1. If any Team to be paid has multiple Owners, the payment will be split equally among those Owners. 

## 4. Dispute Resolution

1. Unless stated otherwise by these Bylaws, disputes among Owners are resolved by Vote.
1. Calling a Vote
   1. Any Owner may request for a Vote from the Commissioner on any issue, including the interpretation of contradictory, ambiguous, or missing points of these Bylaws.
   1. When a Vote is requested the Commissioner will without undue delay communicate the circumstances of the Vote to all Owners. This will include clearly describing the (at least two) options among which a choice is being sought.
   1. Any Owner may request a clarification of the circumstances or options of the Vote from the Commissioner.
1. Deciding a Vote
   1. Each Team is allocated one vote.
      1. If a Team has multiple Owners, the first Owner to render his vote will count for that Team's vote, irrespective of the agreement (or even awareness) of the other Owner(s) of that Team.
      1. Any rendered vote may be retracted or altered by the Owner that rendered it at any time before the Commissioner announces the final result of the Vote.
   1. A vote of "ABSTAIN" is permitted by any Team.
   1. The Commissioner is responsible for collecting each Team's vote and communicating them among the Owners.
      1. A reasonable effort must be made to collect each Team's vote. If after such effort, Teams remain that have not yet rendered a vote, those votes will be automatically rendered "ABSTAIN".
   1. Once all Teams have rendered a vote, the option receiving the most non-abstaining votes will be declared the winning option.
      1. A majority is not required in circumstances when there are more than two options.
      1. In the event of no single option receiving the most non-abstaining votes, the Commissioner decides the Vote in the best interest of the League from among the options with the most non-abstaining votes.
1. Applicability
   1. Unless otherwise specified in the circumstances of the Vote, each Vote resolves only the immediate dispute and should not be interpreted as an alteration of these Bylaws or as creating a precedent that applies to any identical or substantially similar disputes in the future.
   1. These Bylaws may be altered by Vote with the exception that no Team's vote will be automatically rendered "ABSTAIN" by virtue of non-response.
      1. It is customary (although not required) that Bylaw changes be made effective no sooner than the beginning of the next season following the change.

## 5. Website

1. The League uses a Website to simplify the daily operation of the League. To the extent that the Website behaves in a way that is not contradictory to these Bylaws, its behavior should be considered binding.
1. If the Website is discovered to behave contradictory to these Bylaws, the Website should be adjusted to bring it into concordance and any already-occurred contradictory results should be corrected.
   1. If the contradictory behavior cannot be corrected, a Vote(s) should be called to decide a resolution.
1. Changing to a different Website requires a Vote to be won.

## 7. Matchups

1. Roster Format
   1. Each Team has a roster of players. Unless otherwise stated in these Bylaws, each Team's roster may never include more than 14 players.
      1. For the 2020 season, each Team's roster may include one additional player.
         1. This player must have an "Out" or "Injured Reserve" injury designation. When this player loses the required injury designation, the Team's roster must be adjusted to remove a player unless another player on the roster carries the required injury designation.
         1. This player may not be added to the Lineup of their Team.
   1. Each player is assigned one or more positions.
   1. Each player may be on at most one roster at any time.
   1. For each Matchup, each Team's Owner must set in the Website a valid Lineup consisting of exactly one QB, two RB's, two WR's, one TE, one K, and one DST drawn from the Team's roster.
      1. Each player on a roster Locks at the kickoff of their NFL game for the week. A player may not be added or removed from the Lineup once they are Locked.  All players unlock following the final NFL game of each week.
      1. If following the final NFL game of the week a Team has failed to set a valid Lineup, that Team forfeits its Matchup for that week. Players still earn points, but the Team records a loss (and their opponent records a win) regardless of the final Scores of the Matchup.
      1. A rostered player being on NFL bye, injured reserve, suspension, or not playing for any other reason does not disqualify him from being added to the Lineup at the allowed times. If in a Lineup, such players count towards the positional requirements of a valid Lineup.
      1. Players on a Team's roster but not in its Lineup comprise the Team's Bench for the Matchup.
   1. A Team's roster persists into the offseason following the conclusion of the Championship Matchup until it is cleared at the start of the following season's Draft.

1. Scoring
   1. The total points earned by each Team's Lineup through the final NFL game of the week is the Team's Score for the Matchup.
   1. In each Matchup, the Team whose Score is greater is the winner; the other Team is the loser. If the Scores earned by both Teams in a Matchup are equal, the Matchup ends in a tie (if permitted).
      1. If a Matchup is not permitted to end in a tie, but both Teams have an equivalent Score, then the following tie-breakers are used:
         1. Most points earned by the Team's Bench.  
         1. Coin Flip to be conducted by the Commissioner and witnessed by at least one other Owner of a Team not involved in the Matchup.
   1. Players earn points according to the following rules. Fractional points are earned for yardage-based scoring rules.
      1. QB/RB/WR/TE/K:
         1. Passing
            1. Every 25 passing yards = 1pt
            1. Passing TD = 6pts
            1. Passing 2PC = 2pts
            1. Interception thrown = -2pts
         1. Rushing
            1. Every 10 rushing yards = 1pt
            1. Rushing TD = 6pts

         1. Miscellaneous
            1. Fumble Lost = -2pts
            1. Fumble Recovered For TD = 6pts
      1. DST:
         1. Defense

            1. Interception = 2pts
            1. Fumble recovered = 2pts
            1. Safety = 3pts
            1. Touchdown = 6pts
         1. Points Allowed
            1. 0 points allowed = 10pts
            1. 1-6 points allowed = 8pts
            1. 7-13 points allowed = 6pts
            1. 14-17 points allowed = 4pts
            1. 18-27 points allowed = 2pts
   1. If a player participates in both offense and defense/special teams during his NFL game, his points accrue according to his role in each play: points earned while on offense accrue to the Team (if any) that rosters him as an offensive player and points earned while on defense/special teams accrue to the Team (if any) that rosters his DST.

## 8. Draft

1. Format
   1. The League uses a 14-round snake draft, resulting in 168 total picks.
   1. The Draft order is decided by Lottery, which is a weighted random drawing (or computer simulation of such). The Lottery provides each Team a greater chance of being earlier in the Draft order than those Teams that finished higher in the prior season's Final Standings, and a lesser chance of being earlier in the order than those Teams that finished lower in the prior season's Final Standings.
      1. Each Team is assigned a Lottery selection percentage that dictates their likelihood of being selected in the random drawing. A Team's Lottery selection percentage is equal to the Team's position in the Final Standings divided by 78, summarized below.

         | Final Standings Position | Lottery selection percentage |
         | :--: | :--: |
         | 12th | 15.38% |
         | 11th | 14.1% |
         | 10th | 12.82% |
         | 9th | 11.54% |
         | 8th | 10.26% |
         | 7th | 8.97% |
         | 6th | 7.69% |
         | 5th | 6.41% |
         | 4th | 5.13% |
         | 3rd | 3.85% |
         | 2nd | 2.56% |
         | 1st | 0.13% |
      1. The Lottery is conducted by the Commissioner and witnessed by at least one Owner.
1. Keepers
   1. The League uses a modified keeper approach that permits (but does not obligate) each Team's Owner to select one Keeper player for their Team, provided certain conditions are met.
   1. No player that was a Keeper in the prior season's Draft may be a Keeper.
   1. Only a player on the Team's roster at the start of the Draft, before the rosters are cleared, may be a Keeper for that Team. When rosters are cleared at the beginning of the Draft, each Team's Keeper becomes the first player added to their roster, making the Keeper ineligible to be drafted.
   1. To have a Keeper, each Team must forfeit one of its Draft picks unless their Keeper was undrafted in the prior season. If a Team does not have the required pick to forfeit at the start of the Draft then the Keeper is nullified, the Team has no Keeper, and the player is eligible to be drafted by any Team during the Draft. During the Draft, no Team may make a Trade that would cause it to be left with no pick that satisfies their Keeper's pick forfeiture requirement.
      1. Each Team must forfeit their assigned pick (according to the Draft order) from the Draft round where its Keeper was drafted in the prior season's Draft.
1. Making picks
   1. During the Draft, picks will be recorded either manually or using the Website, at the discretion of the Commissioner.  Each pick will be announced by its Owner, recorded, and then confirmed by that Owner at which time the pick is considered completed.
   1. A completed pick may not be reversed except due to an error or violation of these Bylaws discovered later that would have rendered the pick invalid if known at the time of the pick. Resolution of such a circumstance will be resolved by Vote.
   1. Each pick will have a time limit of 90 seconds to be completed. At the conclusion of this, a warning will be given to the pick's Owner.
   1. The Draft may be paused at any time by mutual agreement of the Owners present and resumed upon their mutual agreement.
   1. If an Owner cannot be physically present, they may make their picks remotely via telepresence.
   1. If an Owner cannot participate in the Draft via physical or telepresence, they may delegate another Owner to make their picks for them while they are not present. The absent Owner may provide in advance as much or as little guidance in how to make the picks to the delegate Owner as they wish. The delegate Owner must make all reasonable attempts to honor this guidance in the best interest of the absent Owner, and must make all reasonable attempts not to unfairly improve their own Draft results through the foreknowledge of this guidance.
      1. If the Website is being used to record the Draft picks, the absent Owner may choose to delegate to the Website itself to make his picks (if such feature is offered by the Website) instead of to another Owner.
      1. If there is reasonable uncertainty in how to correctly interpret the guidance provided by the absent Owner at the time that their pick is due to the made, the Commissioner will make the pick in the best interest of the absent Owner.
   1. A Team is not required to use all of its picks, nor to select any particular mix of player positions with its picks.
   1. It is possible for a Team to conclude the Draft with more than 14 players on its roster if the Team's Keeper did not require the forfeiture of a Draft pick or the Team acquired additional picks via Trade.  The Team's Owner must reduce the roster to no more than 14 players (or, in the 2020 season, 15 players if one player carries the required injury designation; see ยง7.1 "Roster Format") no later than the kickoff of the first game of the NFL regular season.

1. Scheduling
   1. The Draft is held no less than one week and no more than six weeks before the opening game of the NFL season.
   1. The Draft order is decided and announced to all Owners by the Commissioner no less than two weeks before the date of the Draft.
   1. The Owner of each Team must announce their Keeper (if any) to all Owners no later than one week before the Draft. Teams that make no such announcement are assumed to have no Keeper. 
   1. The Draft is held at a specific time and location that is mutually agreed upon by all Owners.
1. At the conclusion of the Draft, it is customary (although not required) to compliment Shaggy on the quality and wisdom of his Draft results.

## 9. Trades

1. Owners may Trade any player on their roster and any unused Draft pick they own.
   1. If the Draft order has not yet been determined, a Trade may designate traded Draft picks by round instead of absolute position.
1. Trades may involve any number of Teams.
1. When the Owners of all Teams involved in the Trade agree to the terms of the Trade, the Trade is considered completed and (if necessary) rosters are adjusted. Those Owners should communicate the terms of the trade to the Commissioner, who will announce without undue delay the completed Trade to all Owners.
1. Trades may be completed at any time, with the following exceptions:
   1. During the Trade blackout window that begins on the Thursday following the 9th week of the regular season and ends at the conclusion of the Championship Matchup.

## 10. Waivers and Free Agency

1. The League uses a waiver system for players that are dropped from rosters. 
1. At the conclusion of the Draft the waiver order is reset to the reverse of the Draft order.
1. When a Team's waiver claim is filled, the Team is moved to the bottom of the waiver order.
1. A Team may make as many waiver claims as they wish, including simultaneously.
1. During the NFL season, waiver claims are processed in the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Otherwise, waiver claims are processed every day.
1. A player on waivers may only be added to a roster by means of a filled waiver claim.
1. When a player is dropped from a roster, that player is placed on waivers for at least 24 hours. If the player is not added to a roster via filled waiver claim the next time waiver claims are processed following that period, then the player becomes a Free Agent.
1. Free Agents may be immediately added to any roster that has room.
1. At the conclusion of the Draft, all players not on a roster become Free Agents.

## 11. Accolades and Opprobrium

1. The Owners of the Team that wins the Championship Matchup are awarded the League's Frog Trophy at the following season's Draft and are entitled to possess the Trophy during the season. They are also entitled to add their name, Team name, and a small token to the Trophy.
1. The Owners of the two Teams that finish at the bottom of the Final Standings are obligated to organize and provide, at no cost to anyone beside themselves, lunch at the following season's Draft to those Owners that are physically present.
